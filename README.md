# QCL-Workshop-Data-Wrangling-with-R-Level-2
### Data Wrangling with R (Level 2)

## Summary

Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysts and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. Thus, it is essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using the well-known data science package called tidyverse.
